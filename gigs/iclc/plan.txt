my maker melts me
parts bin
ignore file
intro
unsorted list

obviously only have 30 mins so will have to pick

# track notes

## LESS
- convert melody to volca bass line
- slice up amen
- code up parts

## DEFRAG
- slice up all the drums
- what to do with the long synths
- one shots for kick/snare
- convert bass to volca bass line ???
- code up parts and practice. not sure how to do this one yet
- might not need the true track. leave out long synths. just do
bass, defdo, and breaks. remember volcal stretching.

## ignore file
think I have everything. can use amenall.

## intro
don't really know what I'm doing with this one.
intro + double bass + snare.
maybe create a dedicated snare?
maybe create a crazy acid high bass line?

# parts bin
need to organize
some kind of synth line?

# component factory
organize and create parts

# unsorted list
organization and practice. not sure how to pull this one off.
