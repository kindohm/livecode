# tentative set list
alone (190)
lesss (190)
socket lever (175)
def (210) (with intro outro)

# CREATE A BRANCH WHEN PRACTICING

# work left...

- Alone - new drum samples. maybe use selfie drums?
- custom "screws" for each track
- remove socket lever from set?
- change cutoff param in volca bass module


# PLAN B
- leeds intro -> socket lever
- lesss
- def
- "intro" w double bass improv thing

could put the intro before less or def too, really. whatever.
