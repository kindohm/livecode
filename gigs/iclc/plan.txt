# tentative set list
alone (190)
lesss (190)
socket lever (175)
def (210) (with intro outro)

# CREATE A BRANCH WHEN PRACTICING

# work left...

- Alone - new drum samples. maybe use selfie drums?
- custom "screws" for each track
- remove socket lever from set?
- change cutoff param in volca bass module


# PLAN B
- 5/4 kick 120bpm thing. 7/4 "self" synth. cpr's, ch's, percs, the whole thing
- lesss
- def
- intro/synthimprov / socket lever

could put the intro before less or def too, really. whatever.
